#probably want this to contain just true false, and have a constants file
#maybe the bash script can edit the constants file for things like step size

#for cleaning the directory etc

#trajectory for this is wrong!
MULTI_C_SIM=true

BASE_PY_SIM=false

NUMPY_SIM=true


#takes ~10 minutes!
MULTI_PY_SIM=true


#for plotting the results
#maybe only record the trajectroy if this is true?

#this dictates if the real solar system is used or a generic n-body problem with more 
#bodies for comparison of methods!
#this is a bit of a placeholder!
#REAL=false -> shows multiprocessing being best! followed closely by numpy!
#WOAH
REAL=false


#another one
#is this the correct amount of planets???
