#probably want this to contain just true false, and have a constants file
#maybe the bash script can edit the constants file for things like step size
#and plotting?

#for cleaning the directory etc
CLEAN=false


RUN_C_SIM=true

RUN_PY_SIM=false


#for plotting the results
#maybe only record the trajectroy if this is true?
PLOT_TRAJ=false


#another one
#is this the correct amount of planets???
INITIAL_BODIES=9
