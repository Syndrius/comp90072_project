#This file controls which simulations and which scenarios are run
#all options must be either true or false in all lowercase

#set to true for the basic C simulation to be run
BASE_C_SIM=true

#set to true for the C simulation with multiprocessing to be run
MULTI_C_SIM=false

#set to true for the basic python simulation to be run
BASE_PY_SIM=false

#set to true for the python simulation with numpy to be run
NUMPY_SIM=false


#set to true for the python simulation with multiprocessing to be run
#note that this takes ~10 minutes when REAL=true
MULTI_PY_SIM=false


#If set to true, this will run the simulation using the real planets coordinates
#then will plot the trajectories of the planets and the time taken by each sim
REAL=true


#If REAL=false and this is true, creates heatmaps comparing the simulations
#this always excludes the basic python simulation, but uses the other 4
#this can take a while!
HEATMAP=true


#If REAL=false and HEATMAP=false, the simulation will run with the chosen sims,
#with randomly generated data with the following number of bodies and iterations
ITERS=50
NUM_BODIES=10
